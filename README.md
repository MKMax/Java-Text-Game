# Transience
Hey! Welcome to our humble game repository. It's a very classical game with a little salt and pepper sprinkled on the graphics side. It's not quite done yet, but definitely feel free to browse the code or some screenshots down below. Heck, you can even compile the thing, and run it yourself! (Just make sure you have at the very least: the already ancient Java 8 and OpenGL 3.0 support).
