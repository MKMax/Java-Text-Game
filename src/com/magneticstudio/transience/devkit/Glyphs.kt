/**
 * From now on, I would like to begin integrating Kotlin with this
 * project as it has very much impressed me with how efficient
 * it is in both regards to programming and execution time. This
 * is the first kotlin file introduced to this project, and with it
 * the kotlin runtime library located in Transience/lib/...
 *
 * At the moment the creation of the OpenGL context is still
 * handled by slick2d, but it is obvious that performance is already
 * suffering quite badly and the game isn't that far into development.
 * As such, it is best to begin "directly" calling OpenGL functions instead
 * of creating hacks with slick2d.
 *
 * The glyphs file contains the code that can render character glyphs loaded
 * from texture files either outside or inside the jar file and display them
 * onto the screen.
